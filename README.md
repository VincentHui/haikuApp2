This is a work in proggress application using react-spring, react router, styled components, three-fibre and redux. Its hosted [here](http://haiku-app-2.surge.sh/) on surge and is much more of an experiment than a production ready application. Use `yarn install` to get the packages needed and `yarn start` to start the application
